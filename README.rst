obspyDMT: A Python Toolbox for Retrieving and Processing of Large Seismological Datasets
========================================================================================

Welcome to obspyDMT version 2.0.0 tutorial!

obspyDMT_ (obspy Data Management Tool) is a command line tool for retrieving, processing and management of large seismological datasets in a fully automatic way which can be run in serial or in parallel.

Software functionality:

-   Query of station meta-data: by absolute time or relative to earthquake occurrences; by geographic area (rectangles or circles); by channel or instrument type; wildcarding (\*) is supported; simultaneous queries of different data centers.

-   Query of earthquake source meta-data: from different catalogue providers (NEIC, Global CMT, IRIS DMC, NERIES, NCEDC, USGS, INGV and ISC); event origin information or full moment tensors; by time window, region, event magnitude and/or event depth.

-   Diagnostic plots to visualize meta-data; plots are generated by simple inclusion of an option flag.

-   Retrieval of actual waveform data (seismograms) according to the results of meta-data queries. Support for different protocols (FDSN web services, ArcLink).

-   Retrieval of time-continuous series of arbitrary length; diagnostic log files.

-   Parallelized retrieval of waveform data for increased speed. Simultaneous retrieval from different data centers.

-   Update mode: identical or modified queries can be relaunched; only new, modified, or previously failed data will be retrieved from the data center(s).

-   Tolerant of retrieval errors and missing data (includes diagnostic logs).

-   Automatic organisation of data, meta-data and log files into standardized directory trees. (At present no tie to any specific database system.)

-   Processing of the data set using default or user-defined processing function; user can customize the processing unit by writing a script in obspy, SAC and/or any other processing tool on the waveform level; Application to the whole data set directly after data-retrieval or as a separate step. Support for parallelized processing. 

-   Application of instrument responses. Support for various instrument formats (StationXML, Dataless SEED). Diagnostic plots of analog and digital filter stages. Option of parallelized instrument correction, taking advantage of multicore architectures even on desktop processors.

-   Retrieval of synthetic seismograms, for comparison to real data.
